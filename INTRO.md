# Immersive Storyboarding
Follow along as I develop a practice of immersive storyboarding.

## What is Immersive Storyboarding?
A definition:

*Immersive storyboarding is a practice of creating four-dimensional sketches to develop and describe stories in immersive media.*

Like traditional storyboards, except the story or animatic progresses around you.

- App-in-development [name TBD]
- PSA: VR makes me sick (see below)

## Uses of Immersive Storyboarding
To design
- an immersive animation
- a VR or AR (XR) experience (including games)
- any sort of story or spatial plan or walkthrough for an experience
- projection mapping
- holodeck simulation

## Traditional Storyboards
Traditional storyboarding ([Storyboard - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard)) is a process of making two-dimensional flat renderings that emulate what will be projected to a two-dimensional screen: for commercials, TV, film, 2d & 3d animation, web apps or for teaching.

These sequential drawings take us through a narrative, and help us test the ideas.

Quick pencil sketches let you play out an idea, and see what it might look like. As you create the sketches, you can revise the story, character, pacing, it’s light-weight and low-cost, and helps you make changes before you make “the good version.” If you work with a team, it helps explain what you are going for, like a wireframe or a blueprint, but for a story.

Story artists and illustrations use the medium of storyboards to develop the action and dialogue of scenes in animation and film scenes, or evolve these drawings into panels of comic books and graphic novels.

Professionally, Storyboarder Pro is the 2d animation industry standard tool.
Storyboarder App is a free, lightweight storyboarding tool.

## Technology
The main tools are newly released 360-degree artist tools tools such as Oculus [Quill | Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1118609381580656/) and Nvrmind’s AnimVR ([NVRMIND™](https://nvrmind.io/), which are similar to [Tilt Brush by Google](https://www.tiltbrush.com/), but which focus on artist creation and animated sketching (Quill) and 3d-to-2d video editing of immersive animations (AnimVR). Other useful tools: Oculus Medium for 3d modeling (you can import a model as a reference/armature and then paint around it.) Gravity Sketch for more "vector-like" modeling. Google Poly (?) for low polygon shapes.

Additionally, for sound, you can create spatialized audio, and experiment with blending regular audio with ambient atmospheric sounds, sound effects, and character narrative. Adobe Audition lets you play a little bit with spatialized audio (and is part of Creative Cloud.) Other tools exist but are several hundreds of dollars, I have not tried them and probably will not.

With sound, you can create the "tele-play" that usually comes before animation is produced.

Your background mattes can be skyboxes, which can also be mocked up quickly using hand-drawn techniques and templates, with some simple file conversion tools.

## Playback and Sharing
Tools like QuillApp are designed to allow you to be in a VR space with others, or post to Facebook, or share to an in-app gallery. Websites like SketchFab let you share and download 360 artwork and models. YouTube supports 360 video or images (if the video file is configured correctly), and you can spin it around without a headset.

Google Cardboard is a more affordable display tool (~$15) that works with mobile phones to display content (though with possible motion-sickness issues due to the size and resolution.)

Animations can be used in 3d programs like Maya, Blender, Unity3d and Unreal Engine. You can "bake" your animation (with colors and effects) as an Alembic file from Quill, and then use a converter to produce a GTLF file, which is the slightly more web-friendly version. You can re-render your file with fancier lighting. SketchFab lets you convert Alembic to GTLF with max file size of 50MB for free, and more if you subscribe.

The files are generally on the larger size. One animation could easily be 50MB, or more depending on the complexity. If sharing over the web, there will be a limit to how much the browser can actually handle.

You can use a WebVR library like Mozilla's A-Frame, three.js, or Babylon.js to share your work, or you can package it up in a game and deliver it to the Oculus store (similar to the App store for Apple products.)

For stepping through an experience, storyboard artists typically work scene-by-scene. To share your work, you could export Quill to Alembic.

## Immersive Storyboarding Tool
I'm working on a tool to make it easier to sequentialize Quill illustrations and put them into a more traditional storyboard framework, as building blox for developing a story. This tool is based off another framework that a XR-programming friend is developing to make VR easier for storytellers.

## Learn Immersive Painting

Last November (2018), I was lucky to come across Goro Fujita's Quill painting workshop at CTN Animation Expo in Burbank, California. He is very inspiring and has a number of online training videos. Based on that class, I would recommend studying the touch controller button configurations, and practicing each tool until you memorize it and painting simple vignettes of actions and objects.

It also helps to come up with an organizational system for your files. As a Mac person, it's so painful to save a file from VR, have to locate it in the PC (which is in an awkward position in my living room), and then move it to my regular computer to do things with it.

4 months after that class, I'm still working on my workflow, skills and tolerance level. This is a very new medium, so there is very very little information to find, so you will need to come up with workflows that work for you. My recommendation is to invest some time in getting organized & comfortable.  

## For writers and story artists
Story development is a hard and messy process, involving many revisions. There are a few main modes of developing stories:

- Script-to-storyboard
- Writing by storyboard
- Back & forth - often with presentational walkthroughs of storyboards

Story has a lot of structure, and takes a lot of work. It's part of the pre-production and development stage of production animated content.

My theory is that animated immersive content will benefit from making it easier to generate and share storyboards and animatics.

There are significant differences for writing immersive content. I'm in the beginning stages of understanding this, but so far,

Immersive content:
- Has more similarities to theme-park rides than not
- Can be over-stimulating
- Has to be "comfortable" so people don't vomit
- A 7 minute experience could be enough, less binge-able
- Minimal curated "networks" & most work is shown like art installations due to equipment
- Participants want to be the director
- Is like immersive theater, or a play-in-the-round, or a play with a giant proscenium
- With programming, can be interactive
- People may be seated or walking around
- More floor & ceiling
- Actors & characters are not necessarily "off screen"
- Can include scheduled performances by live actors & "puppeteers"
- Still needs a good story and hook.
- The Point-of-View (POV) of the participant is part of the story.
- My theory: accesses more kinesthetic memories and causes you to write differently
- Is more like sculpture
- More to come! Immersive content, especially immersive animation, is emerging and let's hope there is a renaissance of beautiful immersive content and spatial art.

My preference is to separate writing from "production", but I enjoy periodically sketching story and characters because it informs the writing.

## Viewing
- VR content is viewed privately, and has been expensive, but with humans who are physically vulnerable (VR tools do have boundary guardians that help you know where your furniture is).
- AR content is animation played on top of the real world.
- Projection mapping can be displayed all around you, on buildings, trees, in mist-like holograms.

## PSA:"VR makes me sick"
Since so many people I know (mostly women) have avoided VR because of the nausea, it's worth mentioning right away: VR also makes me sick sometimes & I am very prone to motion-sickness, but I can still make things.

Immersive painting has caught my heart, it's so different from traditional painting, and lets me use my kinesthetic senses more... and get more movement in than regular drawing.

I use only "comfort" mode to create (the illustration tools are all very comfortable), which are applications that give you more control and avoid hurl-producing glitches. Also, on days that I work in VR, it's usually for no more than 45 minutes at a time, and it took me a good month to get used to it all. The quality of the device also helps. I can't use Google Cardboard for more than a few seconds, but I'm very happy with Oculus Rift and the cheapest VR-ready laptop I could find. The Oculus Quest ($400) should be good when it's available sometime in 2019. The Oculus Quest won't require a PC, but will work with the Quill App.
